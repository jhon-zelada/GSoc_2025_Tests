## Overview
This repository contains three test setups for different scenarios. Below is a description of each test:

### 1. Python Test
- **Location**: `python_test/`
- **Description**: This test simulates the Brownian motion of a particle. The particle moves forward until it collides with a wall. Upon collision, it rotates for a random duration before resuming forward motion. The simulation is implemented in Python.

### 2. ROS2 Test
- **Location**: `ros2_test_ws/`
- **Description**: This test includes a ROS2 workspace with:
    - Basic talker/listener nodes for communication.
    - Packages for waypoint navigation of a TurtleBot robot.

### 3. Undefined Test
- **Location**: To be determined.
- **Description**: This test is yet to be defined and will be added in the future.

## Usage
Refer to the respective folders for detailed instructions on running each test.
